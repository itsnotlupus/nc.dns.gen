This is a simple node.js script that grabs the namecoin DB and converts it into various configuration files.

Note that this is only parsing the "legacy specification" for now, and that there are limitation tied to use some conf. files.

Current configuration files generated:

- hosts.conf : follows the /etc/hosts format. only encode static IPs, doesn't know about forwarders, or wildcards, or translate.
- dnsmasq.conf : suitable to use with dnsmasq. Limited forwarder support, no support for translate.
- named.conf and db.bit : meant for use with bind9. support all (?) legacy features. probably buggy.
